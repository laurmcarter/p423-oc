A terminal interface for the P423 online compiler

Building

p423-oc depends upon the curl binary being in your path,
as that is what it uses to interact with the p423 website.

You can check that it is by invoking:

$ which curl

Curl should be available on IU's machines, and is easily obtainable
as a package in most linux distributions.

All that's left is to build the source into a nice little binary.

While in the p423-oc source directory, invoke...

$ make

...and you should be good to go.

Usage

./p423-oc OPTION* <week>

Where OPTION is one of the following:
-s <starting-pass>
	define starting pass.
-p <pass0>,<pass1>,...
	define passes to trace. (Passes must be comma separated)
-h
	print this help.

---------------

Authorization

p423-oc requires a username and passphrase to authenticate with
the P423 website. To provide these, make a file in your home
directory named '.p423-auth'. In the file, put your username
and passphrase as follows:

username:pass phrase goes here

Keep it secret, keep it safe.

Entering Code

The standard usage of p423-oc looks something like the following:

./p423-oc 13

Which then gives you the prompt:

Code to compile:

You may enter code on as many lines as you wish, signalling to
p423-oc that the code is entered with an empty line.

So, for example, typing at the prompt...

> Code to compile:
> (let ((x.1 '1))
>   x.1)
> 

...will send the code off to the online compiler.

Cheers.

p423-oc
A terminal interface for the P423 online compiler

Building

p423-oc depends on two things: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and curl.
Curl is the component that actually interacts with the P423 website.

Both are installed on IU's machines, and are available as packages in
common linux distributions.

You can check that the curl binary is in your path by invoking:

$ which curl

All that's left is to build the source into a nice little binary.

While in the p423-oc source directory, invoke...

$ make

...and you should be good to go.

Usage

./p423-oc OPTION* <week>

Where OPTION is one of the following:
-s <starting-pass>
	define starting pass.
-p <pass0>,<pass1>,...
	define passes to trace. (Passes must be comma separated)
-h
	print this help.

---------------

Authorization

p423-oc requires a username and passphrase to authenticate with
the P423 website. To provide these, make a file in your home
directory named '.p423-auth'. In the file, put your username
and passphrase as follows:

username:pass phrase goes here

Keep it secret, keep it safe.

---------------

Entering Code

The standard usage of p423-oc looks something like the following:

./p423-oc 13

Which then gives you the prompt:

Code to compile:

You may enter code on as many lines as you wish, signalling to
p423-oc that the code is entered with an empty line.

So, for example, typing at the prompt...

> Code to compile:
> (let ((x.1 '1))
>   x.1)
> 

...will send the code off to the online compiler.

Cheers.
